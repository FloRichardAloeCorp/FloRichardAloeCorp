## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to see you!

I'm currently a co-founder of the web agency [Aloe](https://github.com/Aloe-Corporation). Most of my work is based there!

If you want to learn more about me, take a look at the [VFS](https://github.com/FloRichardAloeCorp/vfs) project ðŸ‘€.

## A bit more about me

I'm a French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· software engineer, and Iâ€™ve been crafting Golang backends for over 4 years. I love programming and challenging myself with new projects.

Being quite curious, I also develop frontend apps with React/Next.js or Nuxt.js.
